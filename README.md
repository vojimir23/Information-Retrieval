Finding topics and communication styles of non-religious Twitter accounts

Social media platforms such as Twitter have appear as common communication channels,
generating large amounts of unstructured data. Mining meaningful insights from this data
presents a considerable challenge, but natural language processing (NLP) techniques typically
offer a solution. By analyzing communication patterns, attitudes, and opinions of
Twitter users, NLP can help in informing and briefing marketing experts, public relations,
and political campaigns etc. The primary goal of this project is to apply NLP techniques
to analyze the communication styles of various non-religious Twitter accounts. Specifically,
this research aims to identify frequently discussed topics on Twitter, cluster users
based on their topic distribution, and analyze sentiment towards specific topics or words.
By identifying groups of Twitter users with similar communication styles and examining
their attitudes towards specific topics, this project aims to provide valuable insights into
the communication styles of Twitter users.
